🚀 AI-Powered Social Media Backend API

This project is a fully backend-driven social media system that supports authentication, secure APIs, and AI-based image caption generation.
After user authentication, users can create posts by uploading an image, and an AI model automatically generates a meaningful caption by understanding the image content.

The project is built with scalability, security, and clean architecture in mind and is suitable for modern social media platforms.
